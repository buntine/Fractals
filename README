Experiments with Fractals

I have written these programs using the Viewport graphics library available in
PLT Scheme (or Racket these days). I recommend installing Dr. Scheme (sudo apt-get install drscheme)
and selecting the "Pretty Big" implementation.

Usage:
  Load this file and then execute the "draw" function, passing the
  filename (without extension) as a symbol.

  For example:
    (require "/path/to/this/repo/fractals.scm")
    (draw 'barnsleys-fern)
    (draw 'pascals-triangle)

  Or (after requiring) call the programs directly:
    (draw-pascals-triangle)
